# OpenGL Renderer

An OpenGL Renderer for visualising _.obj_ files. This project was intended as a learning exercise in linear algebra and graphics oriented programing. For the graphical implementation it uses SDL2 and OpenGL3, all of the linear equations and matrix operation are handle by the file ```LinearAlgebra.h``` which was developed as part of this project. An OBJ parser is also included for loading the 3D models.
